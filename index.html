            <div class="flower-container" data-entry-type="prose" data-title="In Awe of you" data-letter="I keep replaying what you told me, how you stepped on the scale and saw a number smaller than what you expected. You sounded so surprised, like it couldn’t be real. And it hurt a little, hearing that disbelief in your voice. Because I know it’s not just the mirror that’s made you doubt yourself. It’s the years of words you never deserved to hear. The way your mom would pick apart the body that was just trying to exist, just trying to be.

I wish I could take all of that away from you. I wish I could stand in front of every mirror and make it show you what I see, the truth. Because when I think of you, there’s nothing to fix, nothing to lessen, nothing to compare. You’re everything. You’re softness and strength and warmth all at once. You are the body that holds the person I love most in this world, and that alone makes it sacred to me.

When I saw you, really saw you, it felt like something holy. Like I was being trusted with a secret no one else deserved to know. My hands still remember the quiet awe of touching you, not out of lust, but out of gratitude, for being allowed to love you like that. Every curve, every scar, every breath, I adored them. I worshipped them. I still do.

I told you that your body reminded me of Athena.The kind of beauty that doesn’t just exist to be looked at, but to be revered. There was power in you, not the kind that shouts, but the kind that hums quietly beneath the surface. I remember thinking how every part of you felt like it was carved by something divine, made exactly as it should be.

You are the most beautiful thing I have ever laid eyes on, and I don’t mean that lightly. It wasn’t about perfection. It was about presence, the way you existed so completely in that moment. You were divine to me. I would’ve said a prayer if I thought it would do the feeling justice.

If you ever doubt again, love, remember this: the body you’ve been taught to question is the same one I see as a masterpiece. You were never too much or too little. You were exactly right. And I will always, always be grateful that I got to love you that way, to see you the way no one else has, to hold you as if I was holding something sacred.">

            <div class="flower-container" data-entry-type="prose" data-title="Loved by you" data-letter="I’ve been thinking about what you said that night. About the what-ifs. About how things might’ve gone if I never confessed. You already know what I meant when I said what I said. But this isn’t about explaining anymore. It’s about how it all felt.

For the longest time, I kept my feelings buried under the thought that you were someone I could never have. You were my friend, someone I wanted so badly that even the idea of losing you terrified me. So I learned to be quiet. I learned to love you from the edges of our friendship, in small ways, in patience, in silence.

There were nights when I’d think about it too much, when I’d almost convince myself to move on, to settle for someone else, just so I could stop feeling like this. But even the thought of it made me feel empty. It would’ve been an act, something done out of need, never love. Because love was already taken. You had it long before I even realized what was happening.

And now, looking back, I still can’t believe how it all aligned. How one night, everything I had been too afraid to say finally came out, and somehow, instead of losing you, I found you. It feels unreal sometimes, knowing that you loved me too, that all this time, the person I thought I could never reach was already looking back at me the same way.

When you said it wasn’t choosing but realizing, something in me just went still. Because I understood it. You were never something I chose either. You were something that happened to me quietly, completely, and without warning. It was never a decision. It was like coming home.

Even now, I still feel that quiet awe every time I think about it. You could’ve been anyone’s story, but somehow, you became mine. And I’ll never stop being grateful for that.">

            <div class="flower-container" data-entry-type="prose" data-title="Breakfast" data-letter="I woke up in your house that morning to the sound of you moving, soft footsteps, the clinking of dishes, water running somewhere in the house. You were already up, doing your chores

I stayed in bed for a while, listening. The smell of coffee drifted in from the table, sunlight slipping through the curtains and warming the space. It felt good to be back, surrounded by the place that somehow feels like you.

You were coming back in assuming you just fed bentai (not sure if this is the correct spelling hehe) Your hair fell around your face in that soft, natural way I love. You looked up and was surprised, apologies for scaring you. and after that you smiled. You just looked beautiful in the morning light.

After a bit, we started cooking together. You cut the ingredients for your signature beef loaf dish while I set up the small pot and portable stove. We fell into that rhythm again. You chopped, I stirred. You poured coffee, I tended the stove. When you were done, I cleaned up. It moved smoothly, like we knew exactly where each of us belonged.

The eggs didn’t turn out right, half-fried, half-something else, but we laughed and kept eating. I remember leaning against the counter, looking at you, thinking how happy I was just to be there.

Growing up, I watched my father sit while my mother did everything, cooking, cleaning, moving around him while he stayed still. I didn’t notice it then, but I think that’s why mornings like this hit me the way they do. With you, it’s different. I’m not standing aside. I’m part of it. I want to work with you, to share what we do and be present together, even in the smallest things.

At one point, I came up behind you and wrapped my arms around you. You leaned back into me without stopping, letting me kiss your shoulder while your hands stayed on the food. I rested there for a moment, taking it in, the smell and the warmth of you, the rhythm of the kitchen. Then I pressed my lips to your hair, just once, and felt like nothing else mattered. I wanted to stay there forever, holding you, cooking with you, laughing with you, making mornings like this ours, just us together. in my heart I hoped that this routine would continue, for us to be there for one another even in the mundane things, because I never wanted breakfast to last a bit longer than that saturday.">

each hour blurs, the world feels piled.
But then I hear your voice, just once,
and everything slows down at once.

It’s not the words, but how they fall,
soft and sure, they quiet it all.
Your tone, your laugh, the way you breathe,
they pull me back when I can’t see.

Like sailors drawn to a mermaid’s song,
I am pulled to you, where I belong.
No storm, no tide, no endless sea
could keep me from the calm you bring to me.

Even when you sound half-asleep,
your warmth runs deep, it starts to seep
into the spaces stress had burned
and suddenly, my calm returns.

It’s strange, the peace your voice can give,
it makes me want to simply live.
Like the world exhales, and I do too,
the moment I start hearing you.

Each night you call, it feels the same,
a gentle spell that speaks my name.
And though we’re miles and miles apart,
your voice still finds and heals my heart.">
